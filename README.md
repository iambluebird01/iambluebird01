I'm a Software Engineering Graduate from Dongyang University, Seoul, South Korea.

I have a enough knowledge about programming as i learned it at home by my self mostly.

I combined my knowledge at school and the things I learned by myself in Youtube to build my own Projects.

I am willing to learned more in a company on how to work properly and have a experience working in the field of programming.

I'm a fast learner and a very dedicated person. I hope I can have more knowledge in this field by working in a company who would gladly accept me.

I always try to compete with my self, which makes me a better person than I am yesterday.
